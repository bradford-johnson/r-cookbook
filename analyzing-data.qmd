### **T-Test**

A t-test is a good way to see if there is a difference between two groups and "quantifying" the difference of the groups. [Learn more](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-statistical-analysis-t-test-explained-for-beginners-and-experts-fd0e358bbb62) about the t-test.

Lets say I wanted to know if there was a difference between the US and Netherlands when it comes to life expectancy. My next steps would be to create a **null hypothesis** and the **alternative hypothesis**. For this type of question the **null** would be that the averages of both groups are equal, the alternative is that they are not equal.

> Null hypothesis: `average life expectancy of US = average life expectanvy of the Netherlands`
>
> Alternative hypothesis: `average life expectancy of US ≠ average life expectanvy of the Netherlands`

Next I want to select my **critical value** which gives "boundaries" to the acceptance of the test. A common critical value that is used is **0.05**, and this means that there is a 5% chance if done 100 times, that I will reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative. Critical values such as 0.01 is even more accurate as there is a 1% chance of rejecting the null, but a 99% chance of retaining the null, so choosing a critical value can be a balancing act.

> Critical Value: `𝛼 = 0.05`

Now to run the t-test to see the results.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# load packages: gapminder for data + tidyverse meta package
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)

# filter data for life exp and countries: US and Netherlands
df1 <- gapminder %>%
  select(country, lifeExp) %>%
  filter(country == "United States" | country == "Netherlands") 
  
 t.test(data = df1, lifeExp ~ country)
```

The results of our t-test show us that the Netherlands has a higher average life expectancy than the US, however with a `p-value of .086` I will retain my null hypothesis as there is not a statistical significance in the difference of the means for each of the countries.
