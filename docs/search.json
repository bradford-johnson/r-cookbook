Learn more about the t-test.\nLets say I wanted to know if there was a difference between the US and Netherlands when it comes to life expectancy. My next steps would be to create a null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis. For this type of question the null would be that the averages of both groups are equal, the alternative is that they are not equal.\n\nNull hypothesis: average life expectancy of US = average life expectanvy of the Netherlands\nAlternative hypothesis: average life expectancy of US ‚â† average life expectanvy of the Netherlands\n\nNext I want to select my critical value which gives ‚Äúboundaries‚Äù to the acceptance of the test. A common critical value that is used is 0.05, and this means that there is a 5% chance if done 100 times, that I will reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative. Critical values such as 0.01 is even more accurate as there is a 1% chance of rejecting the null, but a 99% chance of retaining the null, so choosing a critical value can be a balancing act.\n\nCritical Value: ùõº = 0.05\n\nNow to run the t-test to see the results.\n\n# load packages: gapminder for data + tidyverse meta package\nlibrary(gapminder)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# filter data for life exp and countries: US and Netherlands\ndf1 <- gapminder %>%\n  select(country, lifeExp) %>%\n  filter(country == \"United States\" | country == \"Netherlands\") \n  \n t.test(data = df1, lifeExp ~ country)\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  lifeExp by country\nt = 1.804, df = 20.316, p-value = 0.08608\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group Netherlands and group United States is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -0.3366519  4.6766519\nsample estimates:\n  mean in group Netherlands mean in group United States \n                    75.6485                     73.4785 \n\n\nThe results of our t-test show us that the Netherlands has a higher average life expectancy than the US, however with a p-value of .086 I will retain my null hypothesis as there is not a statistical significance in the difference of the means for each of the countries.\nWhat if I look at the life expectancy between the US and South Africa with the same parameters as before?\n\n# filter data for life exp and countries: US and South Africa\ndf2 <- gapminder %>%\n  select(country, lifeExp) %>%\n  filter(country == \"United States\" | country == \"South Africa\") \n  \n t.test(data = df2, lifeExp ~ country)\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  lifeExp by country\nt = -10.549, df = 18.243, p-value = 3.392e-09\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group South Africa and group United States is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -23.36235 -15.60832\nsample estimates:\n mean in group South Africa mean in group United States \n                   53.99317                    73.47850 \n\n\nAs you can see there is a much larger difference in the average life expectancy between the countries, and with a p-value of 3.392e-09. This p-value is in scientific notation as it is such a small decimal, in decimal form it would be 0.000000003392 which is much smaller than .05 meaning this difference in life expectancy is statistically significant. In this case I would reject my null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis that the average life expectancy of the United States is not equal to the average life expectancy of South Africa.\nIf I where reporting this insight, I could say that the life expectancy in the United States is significantly higher than that of South Africa‚Ä¶ and instead of giving the p-value in decimal format or scientific notation, I could say p < .05."
