For example, if you have geographic data, then using a map can be an option. The visual you pick also should be effective at telling the story for your stakeholders.\nFor the different visualizations, I will group them based on what they show:"

It may look like a “bar char” with many bars, however each “bar” is a bin, and it represents a range of numbers that falls within it’s respective bin. The height of the “bar” shows a count of how many values fall within a bin.\n\nsample_means_df %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = sample_means)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 30) +\n  labs(title = \"Histogram\", y = \"Count\", x = \"Sample Means\")"
