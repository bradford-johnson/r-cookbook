# Collecting Data

The first step to any data analytics project is collecting data. This step may not be always necessary as in many cases the data has already been collected. For example in my current role we get daily analytics emails each morning that contain the data from the previous day. So if this data is relevant and all we need for our analysis we can skip collecting the data.

But what if we wanted to gain different insights that require new data? Then we would need to collect new data. Depending on what I was doing I could add more data to the current data I have, or create a new set of data all together.
