This repository is an 'R cookbook' that I created with inspiration from others such as [Cookbook for R](http://www.cookbook-r.com/) or [R Graphics Cookbook](https://books.google.com/books?id=fxL4tu5bzAAC&printsec=frontcover&hl=en#v=onepage&q&f=false)

**The reasons I wanted to create my own 'R Cookbook':** <br> 
> **1.** I wanted to explore Quarto and learn how to create reports or tell a story.  
> <br> 
> **2.** I like how 'cookbook' sounds...and to me it shows how analogous the overall processes for cooking food and data analytics are.
> <br> 
> **Examples of how I:**
> > - approach different problems
> > - craft aesthetics for visuals
> > - 'do data analytics' with R  
> 
>**Goals for my R Cookbook:**
>
> > - to make it a fun project that can share how powerful R and different packages can be
> > - help others who may be new to R or wanting to refine skills in specific areas
> > - show some of my skills and knowledge but also to get feedback and grow as a data analyst and R user myself
