# Visualizing Data

There are many ways you can visualize data, and selecting a way to visualize your data depends on what kind of data you have. For example, if you have geographic data, then using a map can be an option. The visual you pick also should be effective at telling the story for your stakeholders.

For the different visualizations, I will group them based on what they show:

> -   **Distribution**
>
> -   **Comparison**
>
> -   **Relationship**
>
> -   **Composition**
